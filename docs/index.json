In this paper, we focus on the task of Machine Translation (MT), that plays a crucial role for information accessibility and communication worldwide. Despite immense improvements in MT over the past decade, MT is centered around a few high-resourced languages. As MT researchers cannot solve the problem of low-resourcedness alone, we propose participatory research as a means to involve all necessary agents required in the MT development process. We demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of participatory research with a case study on MT for African languages. Its implementation leads to a collection of novel translation datasets, MT benchmarks for over 30 languages, with human evaluations for a third of them, and enables participants without formal training to make a unique scientific contribution.

The quality of the backward system - which is trained on the available parallel data and used for the back-translation - has been shown in many studies to affect the performance of the final NMT model. In low resource conditions, the available parallel data is usually not enough to train a backward model that can produce the qualitative synthetic data needed to train a standard translation model. This work proposes a self-training strategy where the output of the backward model is used to improve the model itself through the forward translation technique. The technique was shown to improve baseline low resource IWSLT'14 English-German and IWSLT'15 English-Vietnamese backward translation models by 11.06 and 1.5 BLEUs respectively. The synthetic data generated by the improved English-German backward model was used to train a forward model which out-performed another forward model trained using standard back-translation by 2.7 BLEU.","tags":null,"title":"Using Self-Training to Improve Back-Translation in Low Resource Neural Machine Translation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ibrahim Said Ahmad","Azuraliza Abu Bakar","Mohd Ridzwan Yaakub","Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"ef626b4f3a57eff30973ed9cf31a8562","permalink":"https://hausanlp.github.io/publication/ahmad-2020-survey/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T15:53:24.928049Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ahmad-2020-survey/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A survey on machine learning techniques in movie revenue prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ibrahim Said Ahmad","Azuraliza Abu Bakar","Mohd Ridzwan Yaakub","Mohammad Darwich"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"f39c013cbf551a2e3310b44954629499","permalink":"https://hausanlp.github.io/publication/ahmadbeyond/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T15:53:24.929451Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ahmadbeyond/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Beyond Sentiment Classification: A Novel Approach for Utilizing Social Media Data for Business Intelligence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad","Pavel Brazdil","Alı́pio Jorge"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"a790dadc5150e7e3e0f37fcac4b45361","permalink":"https://hausanlp.github.io/publication/muhammad-2020-incremental/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T15:53:24.939962Z","relpermalink":"/publication/muhammad-2020-incremental/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Incremental Approach for Automatic Generation of Domain-Specific Sentiment Lexicon","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ibrahim Said Ahmad","Azuraliza Abu Bakar","Mohd Ridzwan Yaakub"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"4d08de37624db7d5f22583229538b95f","permalink":"https://hausanlp.github.io/publication/ahmad-2020-movie/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T15:53:24.934396Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ahmad-2020-movie/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Movie Revenue Prediction Based on Purchase Intention Mining Using YouTube Trailer Reviews","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wilhelmina Nekoto","Vukosi Marivate","Tshinondiwa Matsila","Timi Fasubaa","Tajudeen Kolawole","Taiwo Fagbohungbe","Solomon Oluwole Akinola","Shamsuddee Hassan Muhammad","Salomon Kabongo","Salomey Osei"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"fc22c21a252c0b9895808777f9450f4f","permalink":"https://hausanlp.github.io/publication/nekoto-2020-participatory/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T15:53:24.936538Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nekoto-2020-participatory/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Participatory Research for Low-resourced Machine Translation: A Case Study in African Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ibrahim Said Ahmad","Azuraliza Abu Bakar","Mohd Ridzwan Yaakub","Mohammad Darwich"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"36f285448e3bcc52c9cc61ecbf8815b9","permalink":"https://hausanlp.github.io/publication/ahmad-2020-sequel/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T15:53:24.93233Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ahmad-2020-sequel/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Sequel movie revenue prediction model based on sentiment analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Idris Abdulmumin","Bashir Shehu Galadanci","Aliyu Garba"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"8733e086181392f23633b4c2f8606251","permalink":"https://hausanlp.github.io/publication/abdulmumin-2019-ab/","publishdate":"2020-11-07T05:03:22.911082Z","relpermalink":"/publication/abdulmumin-2019-ab/","section":"publication","summary":"An effective method to generate a large number of parallel sentences for training improved neural machine translation (NMT) systems is the use of back-translations of the target-side monolingual data. The method was not able to utilize the available huge amount of monolingual data because of the inability of models to differentiate between the authentic and synthetic parallel data. Tagging, or using gates, has been used to enable translation models to distinguish between synthetic and authentic data, improving standard back-translation and also enabling the use of iterative back-translation on language pairs that under-performed using standard back-translation. This work presents pre-training and fine-tuning as a simplified but more effective approach of differentiating between the two data. The approach - tag-less back-translation - trains the model on the synthetic data and fine-tunes it on the authentic data. Experiments have shown the approach to outperform the baseline and standard back-translation by 4.0 and 0.7 BLEU respectively on low resource English-Vietnamese NMT. While the need for tagging (noising) the dataset has been removed, the technique outperformed tagged back-translation by 0.4 BLEU.

While many approaches and features have been proposed, social bots evade detection and interact much like humans making it difficult to distinguish real human accounts from bot accounts. For detection systems, various features under the broader categories of account profile, tweet content, network and temporal pattern have been utilised. The use of tweet content features is limited to analysis of basic terms such as URLs, hashtags, name entities and sentiment. Given a set of tweet contents with no obvious pattern can we distinguish contents produced by social bots from that of humans? We aim to answer this question by analysing the lexical richness of tweets produced by the respective accounts using large collections of different datasets. Our results show a clear margin between the two classes in lexical diversity, lexical sophistication and distribution of emoticons. We found that the proposed lexical features significantly improve the performance of classifying both account types. These features are useful for training a standard machine learning classifier for effective detection of social bot accounts. A new dataset is made freely available for further exploration.","tags":null,"title":"Lexical analysis of automated accounts on Twitter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bello Shehu Bello","Reiko Heckel","Leandro Minku"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"4a66ece3e5cc6778c9e6ceb4e8fab62b","permalink":"https://hausanlp.github.io/publication/bello-2018-reverse/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T15:53:24.941304Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bello-2018-reverse/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reverse engineering the behaviour of twitter bots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isa Inuwa-Dutsea","Bello Shehu Bello","Ioannis Korkontzelos","Heckel Reiko"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"7216a3e6462f9b8c938185e2151842e8","permalink":"https://hausanlp.github.io/publication/inuwa-2018-effect/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T15:53:24.945752Z","relpermalink":"/publication/inuwa-2018-effect/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The effect of engagement intensity and lexical richness in identifying bot accounts on twitter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
